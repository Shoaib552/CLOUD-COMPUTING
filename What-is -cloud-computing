What is cloud computing
Cloud computing means using computers, storage, and software over the internet instead of owning and maintaining them on your own computer or office.

Simple meaning
Instead of buying a powerful computer or server, you rent computing power and storage from a company that provides it online.

Real-life example (electricity)
Just like you don’t own a power plant and only pay for the electricity you use, in cloud computing you don’t own servers and only pay for the computing resources you use.

Everyday example (Google Drive / iCloud)
When you save photos or files in Google Drive or iCloud, they are not stored on your phone or laptop. They are stored on online servers and can be accessed from anywhere. This is cloud computing.

Business example (websites and apps)
Companies host their websites and applications on cloud platforms instead of keeping physical servers in their offices. The cloud automatically handles more users and traffic when needed.

What services cloud computing provides
Cloud computing provides storage, software applications, servers, databases, and networking through the internet.

Why people use cloud computing
It reduces hardware costs, removes maintenance effort, allows access from anywhere, and easily scales when usage increases.

One-line definition
Cloud computing is the practice of renting computing services like storage, servers, and software over the internet instead of owning them yourself.

Online banking apps
When you use a banking app to check your balance or transfer money, the app is not doing all the work on your phone. The bank uses cloud servers to store your data and process transactions securely. You can access your account anytime from anywhere.

Netflix or YouTube
Movies and videos are not stored on your device. They are stored on cloud servers. When you press play, the video is streamed from those servers to your phone or laptop using cloud computing.

Google Maps
Google Maps does not store all roads, traffic, and location data on your phone. It fetches real-time data from cloud servers to show traffic updates, routes, and nearby places.

E-commerce apps (Amazon, Flipkart)
When you search for a product or place an order, the app uses cloud servers to manage product listings, payments, and order tracking. During sales, the cloud automatically handles millions of users at the same time.

Work-from-home tools (Zoom, Google Meet)
Video calls are processed on cloud servers. They manage video, audio, recording, and participant connections so that meetings work smoothly without powerful hardware on your side.

Company website hosting
Instead of keeping a physical server in an office, companies host their websites on cloud platforms. If many users visit at once, the cloud provides extra power automatically.

Food delivery apps (Swiggy, Zomato)
Orders, live tracking, payments, and restaurant data are handled by cloud servers. This allows the app to work fast even during peak hours.

Gaming (online games)
Many online games store player data, scores, and game logic on cloud servers so players can continue the game from different devices.

Simple summary
In real life, cloud computing is used whenever an app or website stores data online, streams content, or serves millions of users without owning physical servers.
