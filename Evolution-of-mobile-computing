Here is the evolution of mobile computing:-

Early wired communication (Before 1970)
Communication was completely wired. Computers were large, fixed, and used only in offices or research centers. Mobility did not exist.

First generation mobile systems – 1G (1970s–1980s)
This was the beginning of mobile communication.

Analog technology

Used only for voice calls

Poor call quality and low security
Example: Early mobile phones used only for calling.

Second generation – 2G (1990s)
Digital communication was introduced.

Better voice quality

SMS (text messaging) introduced

Basic data services
Example: GSM networks and feature phones.

2.5G (Late 1990s)
Intermediate step between 2G and 3G.

GPRS and EDGE

Basic internet access

Email and simple web browsing
Example: WAP-enabled mobile phones.

Third generation – 3G (Early 2000s)
Mobile data became practical.

Faster internet speeds

Video calling

Multimedia services
Example: Smartphones with video calling and app usage.

Fourth generation – 4G / LTE (2010 onwards)
High-speed mobile internet became common.

Very fast data rates

HD video streaming

Online gaming and cloud apps
Example: YouTube, Netflix, Zoom on mobile phones.

Fifth generation – 5G (2020 onwards)
Ultra-fast and low-latency communication.

Extremely high speed

Very low delay

Supports IoT, smart cities, and autonomous systems
Example: Smart devices, real-time gaming, AR/VR applications.

Modern mobile computing era
Mobile devices are now powerful computers.

Cloud computing integration

AI in mobile devices

Wearables and IoT connectivity
Example: Smartphones controlling smart homes and wearable devices.

One-line summary (for exams)

The evolution of mobile computing started from basic voice communication and has advanced to high-speed data, cloud integration, AI, and smart connected systems.
